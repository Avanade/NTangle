## v1.0.2
- [*Issue 7:*](https://github.com/Avanade/NTangle/issues/7) The `Table` object `Name` property can now be used to rename a table within an _NTangle_ context and must be unique. The `Table` property which automatically defaults from `Name`, is used to specify the actual database table name where different.
- [*Issue 7:*](https://github.com/Avanade/NTangle/issues/7) The `Table` object now supports none or more `Where` conditions to filter the published data where applicable.

## v1.0.1
- *New:* Initial publish to GitHub. This was originally harvested from, and will replace, the core CDC code-generation and runtime within [Beef](https://github.com/Avanade/Beef).
